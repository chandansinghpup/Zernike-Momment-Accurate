Notes: 
1) Program has been implemented in Microsoft's Visual C++6.0 under
Windows environment and can be execetued under "Build" menu
item of Visual C++6.0 or through "command line". To provide
sufficient memory for its compilation and execution, under Integrated
Development Environment(IDE) choose the options:
Projects->Settings->Link->Category->output->Reserve(insert the value,
say, 1000000000 for one GB of Stack). Without this setting
you may fail to execute the program. Also, it may not run
purely under DOS environment because the memory requirement is
high.
2) This is not a product.
